// 40. Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object
// describing a music album. The function should take in an artist name and an
// album title, and it should return a Object containing these two pieces of
// information. Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different
// albums. Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the
// album information correctly.
// Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the
// number of tracks on an album. If the calling line includes a value for the number
// of tracks, add that value to the album’s Object. Make at least one new
// function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.
function make_album(artist, title, tracks) {
    var album = {
        artist: artist,
        title: title
    };
    if (tracks) {
        album.tracks = tracks;
    }
    return album;
}
// Call the function to create three album objects
var album1 = make_album("Taylor Swift", "Fearless");
var album2 = make_album("Ed Sheeran", "÷", 16);
var album3 = make_album("Beyonce", "Lemonade", 12);
// Print the returned values to show that the album information is stored correctly
console.log(album1);
console.log(album2);
console.log(album3);
